<h1>KARATE-The Origin</h1>
<pre>
Very little is known of the exact origins of karate before it appeared in Okinawa,
 but one popular theory states that it came from India over a thousand years ago, brought to China by a Buddhist monk called Bodhidarma (“daruma” in Japanese).
 Karate is now predominantly a striking art using:
<ul>
<li>punching</li>
<li>kicking</li>
<li>palm strikes</li>
<li>knee strikes</li>
<li>elbow strikes</li>
